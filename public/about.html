<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Born in Maracaibo, Venezuela with italian-milanese background, I got a bachelor of Advertising and Public Relationships 
with a special mention in branding and corporate marketing. After, univertsity, I worked in one of the most important banks 
of the country, where I learned so much while I performed as an analist for the nation-wide Marketing Department.</p> 

<p>Then in 2016, I moved to the United States in 2016, specifically to South Florida, after living one year in Milan, Italy. 
For a while, I worked in a staffing company, but somehow I have always felt dragged to the world of the advertising and 
the digital marketing, so I decided to follow my path. But in the meantime, I suddenly discovered myself even more 
enchanted by a whole universe of endless software programmation where the roof is the sky.</p>

<p>For a programmer, and specially for a new one like me, I feel deeply motivated to dig deep into new worlds of creation and desing 
where I'm perfectly able to portray what my mind can dream and make it come true through knowledge and experience.</p>
